            <p>Planet Earth is the third planet from the sun in our solar system and the only known planet with life. It
                has
                a diameter of approximately 12,742 kilometers and a mass of 5.97 x 10^24 kilograms. Earth is a rocky
                planet
                with a thin atmosphere, and it has one natural satellite, the moon, which orbits around it.

                The surface of Earth is composed of several layers, including the crust, mantle, and core. The outermost
                layer, the crust, is divided into several large plates that move slowly over time. The mantle is made up
                of
                hot, dense rock, and the core is divided into two parts, the outer core which is liquid, and the inner
                core
                which is solid.

                Earth's atmosphere is primarily composed of nitrogen (78%) and oxygen (21%), with trace amounts of other
                gases. The atmosphere helps to regulate the planet's temperature and protect it from harmful radiation
                from
                the sun. The biosphere, or the living part of the planet, is incredibly diverse and includes a wide
                variety
                of plant and animal life.
                
                Earth has a rotation on its axis that takes about 24 hours, giving rise to day and night, and it takes
                about
                365.24 days to complete one revolution around the sun, giving rise to the changing of the seasons.
                Overall,
                Earth is a unique and remarkable planet with a complex and interconnected system of geology, atmosphere,
                and
                life.</p>
