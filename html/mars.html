                        <h3>About</h3>
                        <p>Mars is the fourth planet from the sun in our solar system and is the second-smallest planet
                            after Mercury. It has a diameter of approximately 4,220 kilometers and a mass of 6.39 x
                            10^23 kilograms. Mars is known for its reddish color, which is caused by rusty iron in its
                            surface rocks. The planet is named after the Roman god of war, Mars.
                        </p>

                        <br>
                        <h3>Surface & Atmosphere</h3>
                        <p>
                            Mars is a rocky planet, with a solid surface that has been shaped by volcanoes, impacts,
                            winds, crustal movement and chemical reactions. Mars has the largest volcano in the solar
                            system, Olympus Mons, which is about three times taller than Mount Everest. Mars also has a
                            huge canyon system, Valles Marineris, which is about four times longer than the Grand
                            Canyon. Mars has a very thin atmosphere, composed mainly of carbon dioxide (96%), with trace
                            amounts of other gases. Mars’ atmosphere is too thin to support liquid water on the surface,
                            but there is evidence that water once flowed on Mars in the past. The temperature on Mars
                            varies from -125°C to 20°C, depending on the location and season.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <h3>Moons</h3>
                        <p>Mars has two small and irregular moons, Phobos and Deimos, which are thought to be captured
                            asteroids. Phobos is the larger and closer moon, with a diameter of about 22 kilometers and
                            an orbit of about 9 hours. Deimos is the smaller and farther moon, with a diameter of about
                            12 kilometers and an orbit of about 30 hours.
                        </p>
                        <br>

                        <h3>Rotation and Revolution</h3>
                        <p>
                            Mars rotates on its axis at a similar rate as Earth, completing one rotation in just over 24
                            hours. However, its revolution around the sun is much longer, taking approximately 687 Earth
                            days to complete one orbit. As a result, the seasons on Mars are twice as long as those on
                            Earth.
