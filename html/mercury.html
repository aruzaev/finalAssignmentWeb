                        <h3>About</h3>
                        <p>
                            Mercury is the smallest planet in our solar system and is the closest planet to the sun. 
                            It has a diameter of approximately 4,880 kilometers and a mass of 3.3 x 10^23 kilograms. 
                            Mercury is named after the Roman messenger god, and it moves quickly across the sky, appearing 
                            to rise just before the sun and set just after it.
                        </p>

                        <br>
                        <h3>Surface</h3>
                        <p>
                            The surface of Mercury is heavily cratered and scarred, reflecting the planet's history of 
                            intense bombardment by comets and asteroids. The planet has a large iron core, which is believed 
                            to be responsible for its weak magnetic field. Mercury's surface is also marked by long, steep cliffs, 
                            called scarps, which are thought to have formed as the planet's interior cooled and contracted.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <h3>Atmosphere</h3>
                        <p>
                            Mercury has a very thin atmosphere composed mainly of helium and hydrogen, with trace amounts of other gases. 
                            The planet's proximity to the sun and its lack of a substantial atmosphere mean that its surface is bombarded by 
                            high levels of solar radiation and charged particles. As a result, Mercury's surface temperature can reach up to 
                            427 degrees Celsius on its daytime side, while its nighttime temperature can drop to as low as -180 degrees Celsius.
                        </p>
                        <br>

                        <h3>Rotation and Revolution</h3>
                        <p>
                            Mercury has a slow rotation on its axis, taking approximately 59 Earth days to complete one rotation. 
                            However, its revolution around the sun is much faster, taking only 88 Earth days to complete one orbit. This means 
                            that Mercury has a unique day-night cycle, with one day on Mercury lasting approximately two Earth months.<br>Overall, 
                            Mercury is a small but intriguing planet with a complex and dynamic history. Its heavily cratered surface and unique 
                            day-night cycle offer insights into the formation and evolution of our solar system.
