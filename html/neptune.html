                        <h3>About</h3>
                        <p>
                            Neptune is the eighth planet from the sun in our solar system and is the farthest planet
                            from the sun. It has a diameter of approximately 49,244 kilometers and a mass of 1.02 x
                            10^26 kilograms. Neptune is more than 17 times as massive as Earth, but has a similar
                            density because it is also an ice giant planet. It is made mostly of gases and ices, with a
                            small rocky core. The planet is named after the Roman god of the sea, Neptune.
                        </p>

                        <br>
                        <h3>Surface & Atmosphere</h3>
                        <p>Neptune does not have a solid surface, but rather a dense atmosphere that gradually
                            transitions into a liquid interior. The atmosphere of Neptune is composed mainly of hydrogen
                            (80%), helium (19%), and methane (1%), with trace amounts of other gases. Methane gives
                            Neptune its blue color by absorbing red light. Neptune has the coldest atmosphere of any
                            planet in the solar system, with an average temperature of -200Â°C. Neptune also has the
                            strongest winds of any planet in the solar system, reaching up to 2,100 km/h.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <h3>Moons</h3>
                        <p>Neptune has 14 known moons, which are named after sea gods and nymphs in Greek mythology. The
                            largest of these moons is Triton, which has a diameter of 2,710 kilometers. Triton is the
                            only large moon in the solar system that orbits its planet in the opposite direction of its
                            rotation. Triton also has a thin atmosphere and active geysers that spew nitrogen gas and
                            dust.
                        </p>
                        <br>

                        <h3>Rotation and Revolution</h3>
                        <p>
                            Neptune rotates on its axis at a relatively fast rate, completing one rotation in about 16
                            hours and 6 minutes. However, its axis of rotation is tilted by 28 degrees from the plane of
                            its orbit around the sun, which causes seasons on Neptune similar to those on Earth. Neptune
                            orbits the sun once every 165 Earth years, at an average distance of about 4.5 billion
                            kilometers or 30 astronomical units.
