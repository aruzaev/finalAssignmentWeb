                        <h3>About</h3>
                        <p>Venus is the second planet from the sun in our solar system and although it is similar in
                            size to Earth, its composition is significantly different.
                            It has a diameter of approximately 12,104 kilometers and a mass of 4.87 x 10^24 kilograms.
                            Venus is often referred to as the Earth's sister planet due to its similar size and
                            proximity to Earth.
                            However, unlike Earth, Venus has a thick and toxic atmosphere that makes it inhospitable to
                            life as we know it.
                        </p>

                        <br>
                        <h3>Surface</h3>
                        <p>
                            The surface of Venus is characterized by high mountains, volcanoes, and vast plains.
                            The planet's surface is mainly composed of basaltic rock, and its mountains are some of the
                            highest in the solar system.
                            The planet's thick atmosphere obscures the surface, making it difficult to study.
                            However, radar imaging has revealed that the surface of Venus is dotted with numerous impact
                            craters,
                            suggesting that the planet has a long and violent history of collisions with asteroids and
                            comets.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <h3>Atmosphere</h3>
                        <p>
                            Venus has a thick and dense atmosphere composed mainly of carbon dioxide (96%) and nitrogen
                            (3%), with trace amounts of other gases.
                            The planet's atmosphere traps heat and creates a runaway greenhouse effect, resulting in
                            surface temperatures that can reach up to 462 degrees Celsius.
                            The atmosphere of Venus is also highly acidic, with sulfuric acid clouds that reflect
                            sunlight and give the planet its bright, reflective appearance.
                        </p>
                        <br>

                        <h3>Rotation and Revolution</h3>
                        <p>
                            Venus rotates on its axis in the opposite direction to most other planets in the solar
                            system, meaning that its day is longer than its year.
                            A day on Venus lasts about 243 Earth days, while a year on Venus is equivalent to 225 Earth
                            days.
                            The planet's slow rotation, coupled with its thick atmosphere, creates strong winds that can
                            reach speeds of up to 220 miles per hour.<br>
                            Overall, Venus is a fascinating planet with a unique and hostile environment. Despite its
                            proximity to Earth and its similar size and composition,
                            it offers a stark contrast to our own planet and highlights the importance of understanding
                            the complex and interconnected systems that govern our solar system.
                        </p>
